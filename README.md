## Warning

Usage of this script is forbidden by the TOS of gleam and will probably get you banned.  
**DO NOT USE WITH YOUR REAL ACCOUNTS OR EMAIL.** They will get spammed with messages and potentially flagged for suspicous activity.  
Use at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

- Python3 ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  

## Authentication and setup

- Rename the  [config.json.example](config.json.example) file to "config.json"  
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- It is strongly recommended that you create a second Chrome Profile. This will isolate your usual social media accounts and 			email from the bot.
To do this:  

	 1. Open Chrome and click on Profile in the top right.
	 2. Click Add
	 3. Choose a name and picture
	 4. With the new profile visit: *chrome://version/*
	 5. Copy the Profile Path (On Windows, should be something like "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User 		Data\Profile 2" ). 
	 6. Modify the config.json file.   In the "user-data-dir" field enter the path from before up to the "User Data" part with escaped backslashes or forward shlashes (e.g 	"C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data"). In the "profile-directory" enter the profile part of the path (e.g "Profile 2").

 - If you want to complete twitter actions on gleam you have to register for api access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps). After the creation of an App, change the permission to "Read and Write". After you completed this, generate the keys and copy them into the config file. Again, **do not use your normal twitter account**.
 
- To sign in with your various account run the login script (`python login.py`). This will open a browser window. First, click on any visit action like the one below. Next, finish the action and fill in the required details.  
  
  ![Register](https://imgur.com/4tsJj6U.png)  
Then click on the "Enter with x" elements and connect the corresponding account. The more social media accounts you use, the more entries will be able to be completed.  
  
  When you are done connecting your accounts press any button. After this you can choose if you want to login with playr.gg as well. This is not required but gets you a few more giveaways to complete. After choosing yes with "y", the playr.gg website should open. Here you can login or register an account.
  As with gleam, the more accounts you link (by pressing on giveaways), the more entries will be able to be completed. Available accounts are twitter, mixer, twitch and facebook.
  
## Running the script
After the setup above is completed, start the script (`python giveaway_bot.py`). Now the bot will fetch urls from "http://gleamlist.com" and from "https://www.reddit.com/r/giveaways/". If you configured playr.gg it will also get giveaways from
their site.  
Now the program should open link after link and complete the giveaways.
